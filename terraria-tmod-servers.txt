Friends Joining:
join via IP 
- use router's WAN IP 
- indicate port in 2nd step (don't add :XXXX to IP)


Notes:
- will show players entering / leaving
- tMod will show when it saves the world / makes backups
 - will want to pause normal servers and make personal backups; prob don't need to for tMod but is smart
- prob want to backup the worlds every so often


Recommended (Mac):
change energy settings to turn off display but never sleep
use ethernet
